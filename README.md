"# EcosystemProject" 
Project I made for a Diff Eq summer class. The purpose was to us a Diff. Eq. to model population change with a Diff. Eq.

Basically it fills a grid with
grass: " 
sheep: @ or a
wolves: Â¥ or v

Sheep eat grass, if theyre mature and full enough they will repoduce, same for wolves but they eat sheep.
You can change the rate at which things spawn initially by changing the sliders.
You can also generate graphs of the population over the time of the simulation as well as output the graph data to a .txt
The simulation progresses when you click the button.
